TODOs with Prio (1 important, 2 later, 3 cosmetic)

1 context menu missing in tracks tableview
1 ratingstars as control on cover with infos
2 flash as rectangular with same background
2 minimize by click on taskbaricon (seems tricky https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26972683/javafx-minimizing-undecorated-stage#27254024)
2 update rating in table after new set rating

Ideas
3 Different color/icon for autodj tracks in tracklist
3 non-square covers are stretched through transition stages and then compressed-->looks bad from about 10 px onwards
3 implement transition for updateRightCover
3 Option rearrange songs in tracklist (Doubleclick = Play? ...NO)

Bugs
' in search string ( Syntaxfehler: Encountered "t" at line 1, column 51.)

MINE
- still finds rar at startup
- find cover functionality
- set Albumartist, cover, album, year if changed
