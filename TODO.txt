TODOs with Prio (1 important, 2 later, 3 cosmetic)

1 searching of folders (sampler, genre) & filename
2 tracks in tracklist show bold in databaseview (see updateTable in DbController)

Ideas
3 Different color/icon for autodj tracks in tracklist
3 non-square covers are stretched through transition stages and then compressed-->looks bad from about 10 px onwards
3 implement transition for updateRightCover
3 Option rearrange songs in tracklist (Doubleclick = Play? ...NO)
3 Info- short note of last build
3 Building time of database in min

Bugs
' in search string ( Syntaxfehler: Encountered "t" at line 1, column 51.)
file (autodj) not found throws exception
