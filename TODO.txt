TODOs with Prio (1 important, 2 later, 3 cosmetic)

2 tracks in tracklist show bold in databaseview (see updateTable in DbController)
2 rating in stars not in int in db
2 different volume control

Ideas
3 Different color/icon for autodj tracks in tracklist
3 non-square covers are stretched through transition stages and then compressed-->looks bad from about 10 px onwards
3 implement transition for updateRightCover
3 Option rearrange songs in tracklist (Doubleclick = Play? ...NO)
